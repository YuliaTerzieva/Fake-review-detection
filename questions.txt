Should we use simple features such as length of review? 
If we do how are we going to balance it (or even: is it needed) given that we would have many more bi-gram features.
Can we use hard-coded keywords?
Can we use sentiment analysis?

Okay we have the most frequest words in the whole corpora, but we should do that only on the folds we train on.
But then do we take those to see how many of the words in the given review are from those 30 most frequest words?

How many feature should we have? But then how do we select the most frequest words - without using the fold we test one?

The other option would be to have only the count of words that are in the most frequest, not having the nost frequest as features.
