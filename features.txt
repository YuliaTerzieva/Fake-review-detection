Ideas : 
- 1) we can find the most frequent words in the corpora and then 2) see how many words in the review are in the 10/20/30 most frequent words used (also normalized by length?)
- in general the real reviews are more positive - and have more grammar mistakes also

Already implemented : 
- length of review is done
- Implemented frequent words, bigrams and trigrams
- Punctuation implemented


After we make the punctuation feature, we remove all punctuation and numbers.
